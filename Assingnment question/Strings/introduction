My jorney in Masai School till now.....





hey everyone i am here to share my one month jorney in masai School......before shareing
let me introduced myself.i am Manish Kuamr. I am basically from bulandshar up i have done my bchlersin computer application. currently  i have joined Masai School for developing my coding skills
I came to know about Masai School through one of my friend. 
I like the idea of Masai School how they are giving 
opportunity of learnig first and paying later. (.....gap.....)
after clearing my MASAT, i went through tha syllabus i kinda like 
how they are making us industry ready from 9-9-6 schedule, to providing assignment right after the class to test my knowledge, interactive session to clear my doubts, skillathon session to build my soft skills, they have a perfect curriculum to shape my future. 
now i am giving my 100% to masai.
overall i just want say that masai school is a perfect school to build the coding skills and to get the highest possible sucess outcomes
 

My hobbies are playing Chess,table tennis,Cooking,listining music and fitness.
now also i am adding reading books in the list.  

The power of self deciplane (NO EXCUSES!)..
